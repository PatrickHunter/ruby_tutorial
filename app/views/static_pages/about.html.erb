    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
      is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
      with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
      is the sample application for the tutorial.
    </p>
    <p>I am adding several additions to the program as it is at the end of the tutorial.  Some of the ones I have made so far:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Added the option for non-permanent sign ins to the sign in page</li>
    	<li>Added password reset emails</li>
    </ol>>
